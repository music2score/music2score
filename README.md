The goal of Music2Score is to facilitate the ability to generate sheet music from midi files. We want to eliminate the problem of being able to play music from only a limited selection that is commonly available. Also manually searching the internet for the desired sheet music is time consuming and tiring. Therefore we created Music2Score to eliminate all those problems while adding additional features such as the the ability to convert one’s own unpublished music

We aim to further increase the supported file types for conversion in future releases. Music2Score also provides an interactive and intiutive web interface for easy to use music sheet generation functionality which can be extended to support more functionality in future.
